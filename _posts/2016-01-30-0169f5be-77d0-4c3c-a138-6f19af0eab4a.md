![Cutting-Edge Mobile Marketing for Small/Medium Business](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3c1ff5a2f6b4ac14d558512ae7064145ef8e3e79.png)

TraffiqueJam Mobile, LLC is a digital marketing agency focused on providing cutting-edge mobile marketing products and strategies to small to medium market companies.

That's right.  We said "small to medium market companies."  Why the re-iteration?  Because previously, the overwhelming majority of processes and systems in place to service mobile marketing platforms were only available and affordable to very large corporations.

Today, that has changed...and TraffiqueJam Mobile is right in the big middle of it for YOU, the 'little guys.'  (Psst...and it's way more affordable than you're thinking!)

New customer acquisition is only part of the equation.  Keeping those customers' loyalty and, in fact, turning them into evangelists for your business or company is key to your survival and growth.

Our suite of services include:

SEO (massive platform setup!)
